Format your dates/times as emojis ðŸ•Ÿ ðŸ•‘ ðŸ•—

## Installation

EmojiTimeFormatter supports multiple methods for installing the library in a project.

### Installation with Swift Package Manager 

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

To integrate EmojiTimeFormatter into your project using Swift Packager Manager, specify it in your `Package.swift` file:

``` Swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    [...]
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/thomaspaulmann/EmojiTimeFormatter.git", majorVersion: 1)
    ]
)
```

## Usage

You can convert dates to clock face emojis and vice versa.

### Date to Emoji

Create a new `EmojiTimeFormatter`, get the `ClockFaceEmoji` for your `Date` and print it. It's that simple.

``` Swift
let now = Date()
let formatter = EmojiTimeFormatter()
let clockFaceEmoji = formatter.clockFace(from: now)

print("It's \(clockFaceEmoji) o'clock.")
```

### Emoji to Date

It's also possible to convert a `ClockFaceEmoji` back to a `Date`. Create a new `EmojiTimeFormatter`, get the `Date` for your `ClockFaceEmoji` and print it. It's that simple, again.

``` Swift
let twelveThirty = ClockFaceEmoji.twelveThirty
let formatter = EmojiTimeFormatter()
let date = formatter.date(from: twelveThirty)

print("It's \(date).")
```

Note: Actually it's not a date, it's a time relative to 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.
